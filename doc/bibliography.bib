  abstract="As proofs in type theory become increasingly complex, there is a
    growing need to provide better proof automation. This paper shows how to
    implement a Prolog-style resolution procedure in the dependently typed
    programming language Agda. Connecting this resolution procedure to Agda's
    reflection mechanism provides a first-class proof search tactic for
    first-order Agda terms. As a result, writing proof automation tactics need
    not be different from writing any other program.",
