## AutoInAgda experimentation project UU

This repository holds everything I did as part of the ECOSC at Utrecht
University.

In order to be able to use the Agda libraries is necessary to run the provided
script `setup.sh`

### Structure of the repository

  - the AutoInAgda folder contains the main library
  - the AutoInAgda-benchmark contains the code for benchmarking the library
  - the agda-steroids repository provides a sort of prelude like library fully compatible
    with the standard library
  - the ElaborationInAgda provides a small example of doing Elaboration
    Reflection in Agda
  - the doc folder contains the report
